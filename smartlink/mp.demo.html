          Tech Gift Ideas for Older Loved Ones
      </h1>
      <p>
          My in-laws are in their 70s. They’re wonderful people, but not the most
          tech-savvy. In contrast, I’m a technophile who strongly believes in making
          my life easier and more enjoyable with technology. I want to share some of
          these improvements with them, but they won’t always adopt the things I
          think are great. Here are my insights into the best ways to gift to older
          non-techies.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Commit to Ongoing Maintenance for the Tech Gift
      </h2>
      <p>
          Consider that you’re not just giving the item, you’re going to help set it
          up and troubleshoot it when it goes wrong. For that reason, I often like
          giving a duplicate of something I also own. It’s much easier for me to
          diagnose an issue, describe where to find the reset button, or walk them
          through changing the batteries if I’ve a duplicate of the device in front
          of me.
      </p>
      <p>
          One item I considered buying for them is the
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nixplay-Seed-10-1-Inch-Widescreen-WiFi-Digital-Photo-Frame-with-Alexa-Black/323226725740?epid=10016148106&amp;hash=item4b41d06d6c:m:m_u4BLy5vluLnxGtjuAjmXw">
              Nixplay Seed
          </a>
          . I bought a device to try it out. I love the ability for both my husband
          and me to send pictures to it straight from our phones and have them appear
          immediately on the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
          We just took
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Michelin-Green-Guide-London-Paperback-by-Michelin-Travel-Partner-COR/263587834016?epid=208621540&amp;hash=item3d5f0f28a0:g:080AAOSwc5haxSSo">
              a trip to London
          </a>
          and came home to a rotating show of our favorite memories.
      </p>
      <p>
          It’s an ideal gift for an less-tech-inclined loved one because the whole
          family can send pictures to it.
      </p>
      <p>
          If I had given my in-laws the frame before our trip, they could have
          followed along as we attended Hamilton, visited the British Museum, and
          enjoyed the grounds of Leeds Castle.
      </p>
      <p>
          Before giving them the
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Digital-Picture-Frame-Nixplay-Seed-10-Inch-WiFi-Cloud-Photo-IPS-Display-Blue-NEW/253313884013?hash=item3afaaf1f6d:g:jZIAAOSwHn1ZegdX">
              Nixplay Seed
          </a>
          , I’ll coordinate with my husband and brother-in-law to get some images on
          it for the initial gift and make sure everyone has a linked account to it
          to send pictures to it whenever we think about it.

          the same purpose. He wants a device specifically to keep his music on.

          Physical Gifts over Electronic Copies
      </h2>
      <p>
          If you want to give a movie or an album, go ahead and get the physical disk
          and wrap it up. It’s more meaningful and satisfying for most members of
          older generations. Download codes aren’t usually as satisfying. Trying to
          remember if the movie they own was gifted to them through the Amazon,
          Microsoft Store, a publisher site, or some other platform can be difficult
          and frustrating. So if I’m going to gift my in-laws
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Black-Panther-DVD-2018-NEW-Action-Adventure-PRE-ORDER-SHIPS-ON-05-15-18/232740142221?hash=item363064bc8d:g:kSwAAOSwqpFazW1~">

              The Great British Baking Show: Season 1
          </a>
          , it’ll be a physical DVD.
      </p>
      <p>
          Rights can also change. For instance, I no longer “own” every track I
          bought on
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/App-Store-iTunes-Gift-Cards-25-50-100-Email-Delivery/252849310866?hash=item3adefe4c92:m:m97drK17kABi8OR-m2zJuQA">

          as licensing deals expire or aren’t renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
          A physical copy of electronic media is more reassuring. If you do opt for
          giving them an electronic code, consider gifting it in a

              media-appropriate case

          with all the how-to details pasted into it so that it can be shelved along
          with their physical media and it will be easy for them to start
          watching/listening with a minimum of fuss.

          Odd Resistances to Subscription Services

      <p>
          It’s not that they won’t subscribe to anything: They get their
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-The-Daily-Olympian-Newspaper-John-Lennon-Tribute-13-December-1980/153049946306?hash=item23a27cd8c2:g:UHAAAOSwa0VaGPAg">

              magazines
          </a>
          . But I’ve encountered pushback on anything online that requires them to
          provide payment information as they accept the gift. It doesn’t matter that
          I’m sending them a free box of meals from one of my favorite meal services
          (

          ), they don’t want to fulfill the requirement of providing their credit
          card info. For that reason, think hard about gift subscriptions to Nexflix,
          Audible, or other services that ask for information—or just decide that the
          gift you’re giving will be billed to you for as long as they want it.
